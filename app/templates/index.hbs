<p class="text-2xl">
  This guide intends to help Ember developers make more accessible choices for their applications from day one. You will learn how to create your app, which addons to use, and what you or your team might need to consider along the way.
</p>


<h2 id="section-new-app"><a href="#section-new-app">&sect;</a> Starting A New App</h2>
<p>Let's go through the commands to get your brand new app off on the right foot. First, when you generate your app's files, use the <kbd>lang</kbd> flag to set a default language:
</p>

<div class="w-full text-xl py-4">
<CodeBlock
@language="bash"
id="start-new-app"
@code="$ ember new fluffy-cat-website --lang en"/>
</div>

<p>And just like that, your website now passes <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#page-titled" rel="external">WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.2: Page Titled</a>. If you are building an Ember app, chances are you might want to add internationalization. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl" rel="external">ember-intl</a> addon for ways to do that.</p>

<h2 id="new-app-layout"><a href="#new-app-layout">&sect;</a> Application Layout</h2>
<p>A common but avoidable issue: the application layout is not considered in advance from a code perspective. Did you know that when you use landmark regions like <kbd>&lt;main></kbd>, assistive technology like screenreaders will allow users to navigate a page more easily? When all page content is <a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.3/region?application=AxeChrome" rel="external">contained by landmarks</a>, it provides the markup that the screen reader needs so it can improve the user experience.</p>

<p>I like to set my app's layout in my <kbd>application.hbs</kbd> file, because it makes me think about layout from the very start, and work within the constraints I've given myself. Plus, as I add content to other route (page) templates, I don't even have to worry about whether or not the content is contained! The markup in the `application.hbs` file is applied to all routes within your app.</p>

<p>The template looks something like this:</p>

<div class="w-full text-xl py-4">
  <CodeBlock
  @language="markup"
  id="application-landmarks-components"
  @code="&lt;AppHeader />
&lt;main id=&quot;main&quot;>
  &lbrace;&lbrace;outlet&rbrace;&rbrace;
&lt;/main>
&lt;AppFooter />" />
</div>

<p>Of course, if you don't use a header and footer custom component, you could add them directly to your application template:</p>
<div class="w-full text-xl py-4">
  <CodeBlock
  @language="markup"
  id="application-landmarks"
  @code="&lt;header>
  &lt;h1>My Fluffy Cat&lt;/h1>
&lt;/header>
&lt;main id=&quot;main&quot;>
  &lbrace;&lbrace;outlet&rbrace;&rbrace;
&lt;/main>
&lt;footer>
  &lt;p>&copy;2021 Fluffy Cat Owners LLC&lt;/p>
&lt;/footer>" />
</div>

<h2 id="section-routing"><a href="#section-routing">&sect;</a> Accessible Routing</h2>
<p>Here are three common problems present in many single-page applications:
  <ol>
    <li>When the route transition happens, new content is not automatically read by screen readers. (Want a deep dive? <a href="https://github.com/MelSumner/ember-a11y-roadmap/tree/master/rfc-research/router" rel="external">read some research</a>!)</li>
    <li>When a route transition occurs (e.g., a user goes from one page to another), the focus is not reset.</li>
    <li>A skiplink is missing. Apps need a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G1.html" rel="external">bypass mechanism</a> that links directly to the main content.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h3>How to fix these routing issues</h3>
<p>It will be unsurprising that there are addons for this, but only one addon provides an answer to all three of these issues at once: <a href="https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-refocus" rel="external">ember-a11y-refocus</a>.</p>

<p>To use the addon, install it in your app. If you are using npm, run:</p>
<div class="w-full text-xl py-4">
  <CodeBlock
  @language="bash"
  id="install-ember-a11y-refocus-npm"
  @code="$ npm install --save-dev ember-a11y-refocus" />
</div>

<p>If you are using yarn:</p>
<div class="w-full text-xl py-4">
  <CodeBlock
  @language="bash"
  id="install-ember-a11y-refocus-yarn"
  @code="$ yarn add -D ember-a11y-refocus" />
</div>

<p>Then, add the <kbd>&lt;NavigationNarrator/></kbd> component just inside the app's header:</p>

<div class="w-full text-xl py-4">
  <CodeBlock
  @language="markup"
  id="use-ember-a11y-refocus"
  @code="&lt;header>
  &lt;NavigationNarrator/>
  &lt;h1>Building Accessible Ember Applications&lt;/h1>
&lt;/header>" />
</div>

<p>Remember how we added an <kbd>id</kbd> attribute to the <kbd>main</kbd> when we were setting up the app layout? Well, the skiplink is wired up by default to go directly to the main, skipping the header and any navigation it contains. In true Ember fashion, strong defaults are provided but you can totally customize it to fit your app's needs! For a full list of customizable options, visit the repo's <a href="https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-refocus#options">options section</a> in the documentation.</p>

<h3>Other Routing options</h3>
<p>While other routing addons are not as fully-featured or unobtrusive, your app might need something different. If that's the case, here are some other Ember addons for you to consider: 
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y">ember-a11y</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/linkedin/self-focused/tree/master/packages/ember-self-focused" rel="external">ember-self-focused</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ember-a11y/a11y-announcer">a11y-announcer</a></li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2 id="section-linting-and-testing"><a href="#section-linting-and-testing">&sect;</a> Linting and Testing (WIP)</h2>

<p>Another important way of setting your app up for success is to use linting and testing.</p>

<h3>Linting</h3>
<p>The ember-template-lint addon is included with all new Ember apps by default. Include info about todo feature and how to make sure all of the a11y-related linting rules are turned on, as well as when to use the escape valve for linting rules.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Ember has you covered here too!
  <ol>
    <li>already included things</li>
    <li>ember-a11y-testing</li>
    <li>other useful testing addons</li>
  </ol>
